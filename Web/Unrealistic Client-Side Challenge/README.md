\# Description



Han Shangyan was tired of Team K\&K getting skill-diffed every time they were faced with client-side web challenges. After some self-reflection, he finally accepted that training his squad solely with aim trainers might not be the best approach. Instead, he decided to make a totally realistic CTF challenge for his team to practice on.
