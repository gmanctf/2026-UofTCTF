\# Description



Unless it's from "Go Go Squid!", no quotes are allowed here! Let this wholesome quote heal your soul:



Ai Qing: "If you didn't know about robot combat back then, what would you be doing?"



Wu Bai: "There's no if. As long as you're here, I'll be here."



Now complete with a double check for extra security AND proper hashing!
